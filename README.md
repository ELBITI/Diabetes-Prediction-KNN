# Diabetes-Prediction-KNN
This project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on medical features such as glucose level, BMI, and age. Using the diabetes.csv dataset, the model achieves reliable predictions, making it a valuable tool for exploring basic machine learning classification tasks.
